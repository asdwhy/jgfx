# Joshua's Rust Path Tracer

A path tracer written in Rust. This was a project that I worked on while learning Rust.

Todo list:
- generalize movable objects, instead of having a simple moving sphere
- Leverage simd in math operations. See: https://www.erikpartridge.com/2019-03/rust-ml-simd-blas-lapack
